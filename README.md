# Tahrirchi's Test Task

### Answers

#### How would you automate this process so that we can get new datasets every day?
I would probably create a telegram bot that will receive post from news agency's telegram channel (this can be automated too, but bot should be added to telegram channel), scrape the url provided in message, and get necessary data.
Why telegram bot? Because it is easier to get access to up-to-date news.

#### What file format would you use to store this data?
I would probably use .csv format.

#### How would you evaluate the quality of the collected data?
In case of words, I would probably compare collected words with the dataset of correct ones.
